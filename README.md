# Adaptive Traffic Lights with Emergency Vehicle Preemption 

## Objectives
The principal objective of this project is the conception and realization of an **adaptive intersection control system** capable of dynamically regulating vehicular and pedestrian flows while incorporating **emergency vehicle preemption**. Specifically, the system is designed to:  
- Demonstrate the application of a **finite state machine (FSM)** paradigm for safety-critical sequencing of signal phases.  
- Implement **queue-responsive phase extensions** utilizing photoresistor-based vehicle detectors with hysteresis filtering to mitigate spurious activations.  
- Provide **pedestrian service intervals** encompassing *Walk* and *Flashing Donâ€™t Walk (FDW)* signals with guaranteed minimum crossing times.  
- Enable **preemptive priority control** for emergency vehicles through safe truncation of conflicting phases, incorporation of clearance intervals, and restoration to adaptive operation following service.  
- Offer a didactic platform for the exploration of advanced traffic control strategies within the constraints of embedded microcontroller systems.

## Project Overview
The project emulates a **two-phase intersection** comprising a **Northâ€“South (NS)** and **Eastâ€“West (EW)** corridor. Each corridor is instrumented with a **light-dependent resistor (LDR) sensor** to detect vehicular presence, thereby enabling adaptive extension of green phases. Pedestrian demands are introduced via tactile pushbuttons, which are latched until service is granted.  

The FSM supervises state transitions, enforcing **minimum green**, **maximum green**, **yellow change intervals**, and **all-red clearance periods** to ensure operational safety. Upon receipt of an **emergency preemption request** (via dedicated buttons for NS and EW), the controller truncates the conflicting phase, executes clearance intervals, and assigns **exclusive right-of-way** to the emergency approach for a guaranteed service window. A recovery interval restores equilibrium before the resumption of normal adaptive operation.  

The complete architecture is implemented in **Arduino Uno** within **Tinkercad Circuits**, thereby affording replicability in both virtual and physical laboratories.

- Minimum Green: 7,000  
- Maximum Green: 22,000  
- Extension Increment: 1,500  
- Yellow Interval: 2,500

## Operational Principle
1. **Normal Adaptive Operation**  
   - The NS phase is initiated with a guaranteed minimum green interval.  
   - If vehicular demand persists, the green is extended in increments until either demand ceases or the maximum green is attained.  
   - A transition through yellow and all-red intervals precedes the EW green phase, with symmetrical logic applied.  
   - Pedestrian requests, if pending, are inserted at appropriate junctures following vehicular phase termination.  

2. **Pedestrian Service**  
   - Upon activation, a *Walk* interval is followed by a *Flashing Donâ€™t Walk (FDW)* period, with vehicular traffic held at red throughout.  

3. **Emergency Preemption**  
   - If NS preemption is requested during EW service, EW green is truncated following the minimum green, then advanced through yellow and all-red intervals before NS receives exclusive green.  
   - The converse applies for EW preemption.  
   - Following preemptive service, an all-red hold interval is enforced prior to restoration of adaptive cycling.  

4. **Safety Features**  
   - Hysteresis is employed in detector logic to prevent false triggers due to transient light fluctuations.  
   - Starvation protection ensures that no approach is indefinitely denied service, even under continuous occupancy on the opposing corridor.

- Acquire proficiency in implementing **finite state machines** for real-time embedded applications.  
- Demonstrate competence in **sensor-actuated traffic control** with noise mitigation.

## Validation Protocol
The system should be validated through the following experimental procedures:  
- **Actuation Test**: Cover/uncover the LDR to simulate vehicle presence; measure extensions.  
- **Hysteresis Test**: Expose LDRs to rapid fluctuations; confirm absence of erroneous triggering.  
- **Preemption Test**: Activate preemption buttons during conflicting greens; record truncation and latency.  
- **Pedestrian Test**: Initiate pedestrian requests; verify correct Walk and FDW timing.  
- **Starvation Guard Test**: Maintain continuous occupancy on one approach; confirm eventual service to the other.
